    <p> This is a sample placeholder page. You do not have a similar page, but if you decided to keep this, you can use it to talk about your team, details of your project, or anything else you find interesting. </a>
    <p> While these static parts are not part of your graded project, please note that these elements of your website have interactions with different parts of your system, which are the graded elements of your project. You will see this in a an example in Interactive Session (5). Therefore, you are advised to start by deploying the static pages, and thinking about the client-side interaction with the rest of your system. </p>
